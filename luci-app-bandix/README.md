## Installation


1. First install the openwrt-bandix backend

   Download the appropriate package for your device from [openwrt-bandix Releases](https://github.com/timsaya/openwrt-bandix/releases), then install:

   ```bash
   opkg install bandix_latest_architecture.ipk  # (or apk add --allow-untrusted bandix_latest_architecture.apk)
   ```

2. Install the luci-app-bandix frontend

   Download the package from [luci-app-bandix Releases](https://github.com/timsaya/luci-app-bandix/releases), then install:

   ```bash
   opkg install luci-app-bandix_latest_all.ipk  # (or apk add --allow-untrusted luci-app-bandix_latest_all.apk)
   ```

3. Configure your LAN interface in settings

   After installation, you can access the Bandix application through the LuCI web interface under the "Network" menu. Go to the Bandix settings page and select your LAN interface to enable proper monitoring. Make sure to check the "Enable" option to start the service.



## Known Issues

When the persistence cycle is set too large (e.g., 1 hour, 10 hours, etc.), the rpcd service may crash on some devices, making it impossible to access the router's management interface via web. The system may display password error messages, though the exact reason for this prompt is unclear.

**Solution**: Access the terminal via SSH, reinstall bandix, and execute `service rpcd restart`. Also, set a smaller persistence cycle (e.g., 10 minutes).

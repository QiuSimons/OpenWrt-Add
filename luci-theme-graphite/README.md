# Graphite

**A LuCI theme for OpenWrt**, `luci-theme-graphite`.

Palette, accent and brand name are changed from the interface with the separate settings page [**luci-app-graphite**](https://github.com/Zakkaus/luci-app-graphite).

> [!TIP]
> **Changing the palette, accent or brand name from the interface needs
> [luci-app-graphite](https://github.com/Zakkaus/luci-app-graphite)**, released
> alongside the theme.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| OpenWrt | 24.10 or later — the theme is written against the ucode template dispatcher |
| Tested on | OpenWrt 25.12.5, LuCI branch 26.180 |
| Browser | Chrome 119, Safari 16.4, Firefox 128 or later. The stylesheets use `oklch()`, relative colour syntax, `color-mix()`, `:has()` and CSS logical properties, none of which are polyfilled |
| Depends | `luci-base` |

There is no build step. The stylesheets ship as written; `LUCI_MINIFY_CSS` is
turned off in the Makefile because csstidy rewrites the modern selectors and
colour functions above into something else rather than failing on them.

## Install

`luci.mk` builds these with `PKGARCH:=all`, so one build runs on every device
whatever its CPU. Take the packages from the [latest release](https://github.com/Zakkaus/luci-theme-graphite/releases/latest) and copy
them to the router:

```sh
# OpenWrt 25.12 and later. --allow-untrusted because these are not signed
# with the release key; install.sh passes it for you.
apk add --allow-untrusted ./luci-theme-graphite-*.apk
apk add --allow-untrusted ./luci-app-graphite-*.apk    # optional: the settings page
apk add --allow-untrusted ./luci-i18n-graphite-*.apk   # optional: translations

# OpenWrt 24.10 and earlier
opkg install ./luci-theme-graphite_*.ipk
```

Only the theme is required. It reads `/etc/config/graphite` and works without
the settings page; that package exists so the palette can be changed from the
interface rather than over ssh. It lives in its own repository,
[luci-app-graphite](https://github.com/Zakkaus/luci-app-graphite).

### Building it yourself

Both Makefiles reach `luci.mk` through `../../luci.mk`, which is resolved
against the real path. The packages therefore have to live inside the LuCI
feed — under `package/`, or behind a symlink, the include misses and the build
fails before it starts.

```sh
cp -r luci-theme-graphite <sdk>/feeds/luci/themes/
cp -r luci-app-graphite   <sdk>/feeds/luci/applications/   # from its own repository
cd <sdk>
./scripts/feeds update -i  # rebuild the index, or install finds nothing
./scripts/feeds install -p luci luci-theme-graphite luci-app-graphite
make menuconfig            # LuCI → Themes, LuCI → Applications
make package/luci-theme-graphite/compile package/luci-app-graphite/compile
```

The packages land in `bin/packages/<arch>/luci/`.

The theme registers itself as `Graphite`, `GraphiteLight` and `GraphiteDark`,
and becomes the default only on a fresh install where no theme has been chosen.
An existing choice is never replaced. Select it under **System → System →
Language and Style**.

## Palettes

The default is achromatic. The other five are based on published palettes,
named for the flavour they use in dark mode; each pairs with that project's own
light flavour — Latte for Catppuccin, Day for Tokyo Night. A palette changes
only the token layer: no rule outside `palettes.css` knows which one is active.

Based on, not copied from: the light flavours are published at a text contrast
this theme will not ship. Tokyo Night Day puts secondary text at 3.8:1, under
the 4.5:1 floor, and Latte's body text at 7:1. Every palette here, in both
schemes, is raised to 10:1 for body text and 5.5:1 for secondary. The hues are
upstream's; the text lightness is not. `checks/contrast.py` paints each pair
into a canvas and reads the pixels back, so the figures above are measured
rather than intended.

### Accent

The accent paints the parts that mark the main action and the current location: the
primary button, the focus ring, the active badge, the brand tile in the sidebar and on
the login page, and the current item's rail and tint in the sidebar. Everything else
stays grey. It is off by default, and those parts then use the palette's own neutrals.

Eight names, answered by each palette in its own values, so the accent always belongs
to the set around it: Catppuccin from each flavour's own accent list, Tokyo Night from
[folke/tokyonight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), Graphite from a set
tuned for a grey interface. `accent_custom` takes a six-digit hex colour and wins over
the name under any palette.

| Accent | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| **Graphite + blue** | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-graphite-light.png" width="380"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-graphite-dark.png" width="380"> |
| **Catppuccin Mocha + mauve** | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-catppuccin-mocha-light.png" width="380"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-catppuccin-mocha-dark.png" width="380"> |
| **Tokyo Night + teal** | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-tokyonight-night-light.png" width="380"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-tokyonight-night-dark.png" width="380"> |
| **Graphite + custom `#e4572e`** | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-graphite-custom-light.png" width="380"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-graphite-custom-dark.png" width="380"> |

The four rows above are one interface under four accents, drawn from Graphite's own
values, a Catppuccin flavour, Tokyo Night's palette, and a hand-written colour. They
are switched on the appearance page in
[luci-app-graphite](https://github.com/Zakkaus/luci-app-graphite).

Progress bars follow the accent too. The figure on a bar is drawn twice: once across the
track in the body colour, once inside the fill in the accent's own foreground, clipped by
the fill's overflow, so it changes colour character by character at the boundary. LuCI
carries that figure only on the outer element's `title`, where the fill cannot reach it,
so `progressbar-graphite.js` supplies the second copy and keeps it in step with the poll.

<img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-bars-light.png" width="420"> <img src="docs/screenshots/en/accent-bars-dark.png" width="420">

The text on an accent is not a fixed colour. Graphite's eight values have their lightness
pushed down from measured contrast so white always clears the floor; Catppuccin and Tokyo
Night differ too much between their two ends — a dark flavour's accent sits above 0.85 in
lightness, where white gives 1.3:1 — so `contrast-color()` picks black or white from the
actual luminance. `checks/contrast.py` covers six palettes by eight accents by light and
dark, 96 combinations, and holds button text at 4.5:1 against its own fill.

## Settings

[`luci-app-graphite`](https://github.com/Zakkaus/luci-app-graphite) adds **System → Appearance**, which writes
`/etc/config/graphite`. The values are read server-side and apply to every
browser that opens the device.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `palette` | Which set of surface colours the interface uses. Empty means Graphite |
| `accent` | Colour of the primary button, focus ring, active badge and brand tile. One of eight names; empty leaves it off |
| `accent_custom` | A six-digit hex colour. Wins over `accent` under any palette |
| `tint_hue` | Biases every grey surface towards one hue. A hue angle from 0 to 360, or a colour code such as `#3b82f6` |
| `tint_chroma` | How far the greys move towards that hue. `0` is neutral; above `0.01` they stop reading as grey and start competing with the status colours, so that is the ceiling |

Light and dark are not in this file. They belong to the reader, not to the
device: the three buttons at the top right choose light, dark, or follow the
system, and the choice is kept in that browser. Collapsing the sidebar to an
icon rail is kept the same way.

The sidebar collapses by group. On load only the group holding the current page is
open; a click on a group heading opens or closes it, and several may be open at once.
On a device with service packages installed the menu reaches seven groups and
fifty-nine items, 3196px of content, which does not fit one screen fully expanded.
Collapsing does not apply in the icon rail, where there are no headings to click.

## Phone

The layout breakpoint is 48rem. Below it the sidebar becomes a drawer, wide
tables scroll inside their own container instead of pushing the page sideways,
and the save bar stops being sticky.

| Light | Dark |
|---|---|
| <img src="docs/screenshots/en/phone-light.png" width="280"> | <img src="docs/screenshots/en/phone-dark.png" width="280"> |

A second breakpoint at 23.5rem tightens the secondary buttons in the save bar
so the primary action keeps its label. Narrower than 320px in Chinese or 348px
in English, that label is clipped rather than allowed to wrap the bar onto two
lines. Every current phone is wider than both.

## Layout

Six stylesheets in `htdocs/luci-static/graphite/`, loaded in this order. Each
one may only use what the ones above it define.

| File | Layer | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `tokens.css` | design system, vendored | Every named colour, size, radius and duration. The only file allowed to write a colour literal |
| `components.css` | design system, vendored | Buttons, fields, native `select`, badges, tables |
| `shell.css` | design system, vendored | Sidebar, top bar, content column |
| `palettes.css` | project | The five palettes. Token values only, no selectors of its own beyond `:root[data-palette]` |
| `graphite.css` | project | What this theme adds to the design system: the rail, the login page, the brand mark |
| `luci.css` | translation | LuCI's own class names — `.cbi-*`, `.alert-message`, `#modal_overlay` — mapped onto the layers above |

The first three are copied byte-for-byte from the design system and must not be
edited here; `checks/` holds the scripts that say so. A page's own stylesheet
loads after all six, which is the ownership boundary: what a page ships with
belongs to that page.

The rest:

```
ucode/template/themes/graphite/   header.ut, footer.ut, sysauth.ut
htdocs/luci-static/resources/     menu-graphite.js, theme-graphite.js
root/etc/uci-defaults/            theme registration
checks/                           the gates each rule fails on
```
